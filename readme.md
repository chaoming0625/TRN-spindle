# TRN Model Implementation

This repository contains the implementation code for the TRN (Thalamic Reticular Nucleus) model as described in the paper "Spindle Oscillation Emerges at the Critical State of the Electrically Coupled Network in Thalamic Reticular Nucleus".

## Description

The TRN model aims to replicate the findings of the paper, focusing on the emergence of spindle oscillations within the electrically coupled network of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus. The codebase is structured to facilitate the reproduction of the results presented in the paper and to allow further exploration of the model's dynamics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.9
- brainpy==2.4.3.post5
- brainpylib==0.1.9

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install brainpy==2.4.3.post5 brainpylib==0.1.9
